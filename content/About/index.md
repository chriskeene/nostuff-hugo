My background is in technology within higher education, especially around research and libraries. 

This website goes somewhat through a boom and bust cycle. That latter currently being the case (and arguable always has been, hence the name). 

You will find a collection of quite old [articles in something that looks suspiciously like a blog](https://www.nostuff.org/words/).
