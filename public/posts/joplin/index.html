<p>I looked at a few options but settled on <a href="https://joplinapp.org/"><strong>Joplin</strong></a>. It&rsquo;s great and fits my needs perfectly.</p>
<ul>
<li>Free and open source</li>
<li>Like Evernote (and Onenote), has Notebooks, and notes within them.</li>
<li>Apps for Mac, and Android, which is what I needed (and other platforms too)</li>
<li>Your data is stored in Markdown and fully accessible to you. No lock-in! That is to say, all the content is stored as plain text files using the markdown syntax</li>
<li>Connects to dropbox (amongst others). All my notes are stored on my Dropbox account (as plain text Markdown files). I just point any new device to my Dropbox folder.</li>
<li>Markdown makes it easy to share and reuse content, eg to write this message I&rsquo;m using Joplin, I will then copy this note in its raw form and paste it to a new file on mu Hugo drive website - which also uses Markdown.</li>
<li>Fast, focuses on the task in hand (text notes with basic markup), not adding random new features I don&rsquo;t need.</li>
</ul>
<p>Would recommend to anyone looking for something similar.</p>
