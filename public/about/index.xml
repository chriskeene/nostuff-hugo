      <description>This is the long suffering website of Chris Keene. I&amp;rsquo;m based in Brighton, UK. nostuff.org has been my home on the web since around 2002.&#xA;My background is in technology within higher education, especially around research and libraries.&#xA;This website goes somewhat through a boom and bust cycle. That latter currently being the case (and arguable always has been, hence the name).&#xA;You will find a collection of quite old articles in something that looks suspiciously like a blog.</description>
