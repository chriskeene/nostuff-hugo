      <description>A couple of years ago I questioned why I should renew my Evernote subscription. I was only using the basic functionality and wondered if there are alternatives out there.&#xA;I looked at a few options but settled on Joplin. It&amp;rsquo;s great and fits my needs perfectly.&#xA;Free and open source Like Evernote (and Onenote), has Notebooks, and notes within them. Apps for Mac, and Android, which is what I needed (and other platforms too) Your data is stored in Markdown and fully accessible to you.</description>

      <description>This is the long suffering website of Chris Keene. I&amp;rsquo;m based in Brighton, UK. nostuff.org has been my home on the web since around 2002.&#xA;My background is in technology within higher education, especially around research and libraries.&#xA;This website goes somewhat through a boom and bust cycle. That latter currently being the case (and arguable always has been, hence the name).&#xA;You will find a collection of quite old articles in something that looks suspiciously like a blog.</description>

      <description>We need to remove fossil fuels from the mix of energy sources we use in the UK&#xA;to reduce the impact of Climate Change and meet our Net Zero commitments to reduce local pollution to reduce our reliance on oil and gas that are subject to price fluctuations, supply issues and, in some cases, put money in the pockets of hostile states. </description>
