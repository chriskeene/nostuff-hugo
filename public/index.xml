      <description>A couple of years ago I questioned why I should renew my Evernote subscription. I was only using the basic functionality and wondered if there are alternatives out there.&#xA;I looked at a few options but settled on Joplin. It&amp;rsquo;s great and fits my needs perfectly.&#xA;Free and open source Like Evernote (and Onenote), has Notebooks, and notes within them. Apps for Mac, and Android, which is what I needed (and other platforms too) Your data is stored in Markdown and fully accessible to you.</description>

      <description>This is the long suffering website of Chris Keene. I&amp;rsquo;m based in Brighton, UK. nostuff.org has been my home on the web since around 2002.&#xA;My background is in technology within higher education, especially around research and libraries.&#xA;This website goes somewhat through a boom and bust cycle. That latter currently being the case (and arguable always has been, hence the name).&#xA;You will find a collection of quite old articles in something that looks suspiciously like a blog.</description>
